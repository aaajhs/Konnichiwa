# IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

Terraform code to deploy the Konnichiwa service to AWS.

## Caveats
1. The files in this directory are for reference **only**. They **will not work as-is** because most of the necessary variables and sensitive values have been redacted or removed.
2. Many compromises and workarounds have been made to keep the architecture within the AWS free tier limitations. This includes reduced scaling, minimal resource configurations, and simplified setups. For a more robust, production-ready version that requires resources beyond the AWS free tier, please refer to the [Original Architecture](#original-architecture).
